# The Longest Run Of Heads or Tails - Probabilitati & Statistica
:coin:Acest proiect analizeaza teoretic si prezinta intr-un mod interactiv problema “The Longest Run Of Heads”, pe baza careia profesorul Mark F. Schilling a redactat o lucrare revelatoare.

"The two sequences shown below each purportedly represent the results of 200 tosses
of a fair coin. One of these is an actual sequence obtained from coin tossing, while
the other sequence is artificial. Can you decide, in sixty seconds or less, which of the
sequences is more likely to have arisen from actual coin tossing and which one is the
imposter?" - Mark F. Schilling
